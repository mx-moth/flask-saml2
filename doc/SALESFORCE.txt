INTEGRATION WITH A SALESFORCE TEST ACCOUNT
===========================================

Setup a SalesForce Test Account
--------------------------------

1. Get a SalesForce Test Account here:

http://developer.salesforce.com

2. Accept the terms and ensure that you can login to your test account.

Setup a Test Domain
-------------------
1. Login to your Salesforce test account.

2. Click YOUR NAME > Setup.

3. On the left, under "Administration Setup" > "Company Profile", click "My Domain".

4. Follow the instructions there to create a test domain.

Once you have done this, wait 24 hours (maybe) for your domain to become active.

NOTE: You do not need to "deploy" this domain to your users.

When your domain becomes active, SalesForce will show it to you on this page.
It will look something like this:

    WHATEVER-developer-edition.my.salesforce.com

For the remainder of this document, we'll just say YOURDOMAIN.


Configure SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On
---------------------------------
1. Login to your Salesforce test account.

2. Click YOUR NAME > Settings.

3. On the left, under "Administrative Controls", "Security Controls", click
    "Single Sign-On Settings".

4. Enter these settings for an unmodified saml2idp running on your localhost:
    SAML Enabled: (checked)
    User Provisioning Enabled: (not checked)
    SAML Version: 2.0
    Issuer: http://127.0.0.1:8000
    Identity Provider Certificate*: (select your public certificate file)

        *For a NON-PRODUCTION server, you can use "idptest/sample/sample-certificate.pem".
        For a PRODUCTION server, DO NOT USE THE SAMPLE CERTIFICATE! Instead, use the
        "idptest/keys/mk_keys.sh" script to create your own certificate and private key.

    Identity Provider Login URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/idp/login/
    Identity Provider Logout URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/idp/logout/
    Custom Error URL: (blank)
    SAML User ID Type: "Assertion contains User's salesforce.com username"
    SAML User ID Location: "User ID is in the NameIdentifier element of the Subject statement"
    EntityID**: "https://saml.salesforce.com"

        **NOTE: This is the AssertionConsumerServiceURL for your site. It may vary.

5. Save changes.

Start your test IdP
-------------------
6. Create the Django database and super user account.

$ ./manage.py syncdb

NOTE: Go ahead and setup a super user account when prompted.
    Enter the email address that Google is expecting. It should be
    what you entered when you setup your test account in step 1.

7. Ensure that you have enabled the Google Apps processor. In settings.py:

    SAML2IDP_PROCESSOR_CLASSES = [
        ...
        'saml2idp.salesforce.Processor',
        ...
    ]

8. Add YOURDOMAIN as a valid AssertionConsumerServiceURL. In settings.py:

    SAML2IDP_VALID_ACS = [
        ...
        'https://login.salesforce.com', # or whatever it should be
        ...
    ]

9. Run the Django test server.

    $ ./manage.py runserver

Login and logout using SAML 2.0
-------------------------------
At this point, I highly recommend starting the SAML Tracer plugin for Firefox:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saml-tracer/

10. Open your Salesforce Domain URL:

https://YOURDOMAIN

Google will redirect to your test IdP's login page.

11. Login using your local IdP.

After logging in (using your superuser account), your IdP will redirect back
to SalesForce.

12. Logout as normal.

SalesForce will redirect to your local IdP's logout page.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
Troubleshooting with SalesForce is extremely easy, thanks to their tool, the
"SAML Assertion Validator". Anytime you have trouble with SalesForce SAML 2.0,
follow this simple debugging procedure:

1. Capture the SAML 2.0 Assertion, using SAML Tracer. Just copy the
    base-64-encoded value from the SAMLResponse parameter.

2. Login to your SalesForce test account and navigate to the SAML 2.0 settings.
    See ``Configure SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On'' for specifics.

3. Click the "SAML Assertion Validator" button.

4. Paste the SAMLResponse value into the textbox and click "Validate".

SalesForce will then display a variety of validations, with very useful help.

Additionally, it is important to verify that your Django account is passing the
same email address that SalesForce is expecting.
