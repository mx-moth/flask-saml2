INTEGRATING WITH simpleSAMLphp
==============================

No Official Support
-------------------
This project is not officially targeted at integration with simpleSAMLphp
Service Points. However, you may be able to use either the Google Apps or the
SalesForce Processors.

Certificates
------------
The sample certificate and private key files have been borrowed from the
simpleSAMLphp project. This allows easier testing, using simpleSAMLphp itself
as a reference implementation.

You can find these files at:

/idptest/keys/sample/sample-certificate.pem
/idptest/keys/sample/sample-private-key.pem
