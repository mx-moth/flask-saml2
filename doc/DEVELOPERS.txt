NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
====================

Philosophy
----------
In order to keep things as simple as possible:
1. The Identity Provider code is separate from the Service Point code.
    (How often will you want a site to be both?)
2. The views don't do any SAML or XML processing themselves.
3. Processing takes place in "Processor" classes.
4. Each Processor class is essentially vendor-specific implementation code.
    (Maybe in the future, we'll have a generic, all-purpose processor.
     Want to implement it?)
5. We don't handle or produce metadata (yet).


Processors
----------
Take a look at saml2idp.base.Processor. It's pretty well commented.

Look at the _reset() method for a list of internal class variables that matter.

You probably can get away with sub-classing one of the other processors
and just overriding the method(s) that matter.

For example, if you want to use a different type of Subject, you can override
the _determine_subject() method.

If you want to have tighter control over who will be allowed to authenticate,
override the _validate_user() method.

If you want tighter control over which AuthnRequests to allow, override the
_validate_request() method.


URLs
----
The regular URLs will work just fine. But, if you want, you can override each
view's URL. Make sure that you use named URLs, esp. for "login_process":

    urls = (
        ...
        r('^custom/login/url$', 'saml2idp.login_begin', name='login_begin'),
        r('^custom/process/url$', 'saml2idp.login_process', name='login_process'),
        r('^custom/logout/url$', 'saml2idp.logout', name='logout'),

        ...
    )
